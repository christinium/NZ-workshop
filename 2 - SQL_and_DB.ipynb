    "## Introduction to MIMIC-III\n",
    "\n",
    "MIMIC-III is an openly available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising deidentified health data associated with ~60,000 hospital stays. Spanning 2001-2012, it includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more. A paper describing MIMIC-III is available from: http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is provided as a collection of comma-separated value (CSV) files, which can be loaded into a database system such as PostgreSQL. A list of tables is provided on the MIMIC website: http://mimic.physionet.org/mimictables/admissions/\n",
    "\n",
    "We have highlighted some of the key tables below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- patients: a list of patients covered in MIMIC-III, each identified by a unique subject_id.\n",
    "- admissions: a list of hospital admissions, each identified by a unique hadm_id.\n",
    "- icustays: a list of ICU stays, each identified by a unique icustay_id.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querybuilder (https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/querybuilder/) allows you to explore MIMIC-III with simple queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed analysis, we recommend that you build MIMIC-III in a Postgres database on your local computer by following the instructions on the MIMIC website (https://mimic.physionet.org/tutorials/install-mimic-locally-ubuntu/).\n"

    "\n",
    "Comma separated value (CSV) files are a plain text format used for storing data in a tabular, spreadsheet-style structure. While there is no hard and fast rule for structuring tabular data, it is usually considered good practice to include a header row, to list each variable in a separate column, and to list observations in rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there is no official standard for the CSV format, the term is used somewhat loosely, which can often cause issues when seeking to load the data into a data analysis package. A general recommendation is to follow the definition for CSVs set out by the Internet Engineering Task Force in the RFC 4180 specification document.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://stuff.mit.edu/~cwc76/colab/images_aimed_2018/csvformat.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarized briefly, RFC 4180 specifies that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- files may optionally begin with a header row, with each field separated by a comma;\n",
    "- records should be listed in subsequent rows. Fields should be separated by commas, and each row should be terminated with a line break;\n",
    "- fields that contain numbers may be optionally enclosed within double quotes;\n",
    "- fields that contain text (\"strings\") should be enclosed within double quotes;\n",
    "- if a double quote appears inside a string of text then it must be escaped with a preceding double quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV format is popular largely because of its simplicity and versatility. CSV files can be edited with a text editor, loaded as a spreadsheet in packages such as Microsoft Excel, and imported and processed by most data analysis packages. Often CSV files are an intermediate data format used to hold data that has been extracted from a relational database in preparation for analysis. "

    "## Relational Databases\n",
    "Relational databases can be thought of as a collection of tables which are linked together by **shared keys**. Organizing data across tables can help to maintain data integrity and enable faster analysis and more efficient storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation: why would we want a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine trying to store data about a person: their name, age, and height. We can easily save this data in a CSV:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Name\", \"Age\", \"Height\"\n",
    "\"Penny\", 30, 182\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if we measure Penny and Paul's heart rate every hour for four hours at 8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, and 11:00am. How should we store this data? The naive approach would be to simply concatenate the information we have all in one file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Name\", \"Age\", \"Height\", \"Time\", \"Heart rate\"\n",
    "\"Penny\", 30, 182, \"8:00\", 65\n",
    "\"Penny\", 30, 182, \"9:00\", 71\n",
    "\"Penny\", 30, 182, \"10:00\", 72\n",
    "\"Paul\", \"31\", \"185\", \"8:00\", 88\n",
    "\"Paul\", \"31\", \"185\", \"9:00\", 85\n",
    "\"Paul\", \"31\", \"185\", \"10:00\", 80\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This works, but it feels very inefficient. We have repeated her name (\"Penny\"), her age (30), and her height (182) every time we get a heart rate measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The immediate solution is to not store both of these in the same file: we make one file for demographics (age, height), and we make another file for heart rate measurements. For fun we will add in a unique ID number in case there are two people with the same name.Then, we make sure that the ID is same in both, so that we know who has which heart rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Table Demographics**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"ID\", Name\", \"Age\", \"Height\"\n",
    "1, \"Penny\", 30, 182\n",
    "2, \"Paul\", \"31\", \"185\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Table Heart Rate**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"ID\", \"Time\", \"Heart rate\"\n",

    "## SQL:WHERE keyword\n",
    "Often you will want to select a subset of the data which satisfy some set of conditions. For example, you may want to select only female subjects from the database. This is easily accomplished with the WHERE keyword. The framework of our query becomes:\n",
